                    <p>Implemented the NEAT genetic algorithm to play the game flappy bird. This was implemented with JS and was created during Independent Studies CS in high school</p>

                    <p>Used artificial intelligence algorithms and computer vision in order for a computer to play a game of checkers against a human player. This program started by using a minimax algorithm in order to determine the best move for the computer. Than a computer vision library was started to be developed in order to determine where in an image checkers pieces are.</p>
