                Hello, my name is Tristan Scheiner, and I am studying Computer Science at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I have been interested in Computer Science for about 6 years now and have been learning programming and topics related to Computer Science since. Most recently I have been extremely interested in fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I first started to look into Machine Learning the summer before senior year in high school, continued throughout my senior year, and plan to throughout college. I also plan to go to Grad School after college to get a PhD in Machine Learning and go into fields of research.
